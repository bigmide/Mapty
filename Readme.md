# Mapty App

A workout app built with Javascript, that lets you track your
running and cycling activities around your location on a map using the leaflet library for the map.

## Usage

- Click any location on the map to your left. A form would appear to your left
- fill in your running or cycling details on the form to your left and hit enter.
- Repeat the first two steps for all cycling and running locations
- Thats it. =)

Now anytime you close and reopen the website all your previous cycling and running history would still be available, pinned on the map.
